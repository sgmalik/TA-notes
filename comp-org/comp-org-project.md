# Computer Organization Final Project Ideas

## 1. Mini ARM Emulator

### Description
Students will build a Python-based simulator for a small subset of the ARM instruction set. The program should maintain a register file, memory space, and execute instructions like `ADD`, `SUB`, `LOAD`, `STORE`, and `B`. The system will display register and memory states after each instruction.

### Textbook Connection
- **Chapter 2: Instructions: Language of the Computer** — instruction formats, registers, addressing modes  
- **Chapter 4: The Processor** — datapath, control flow  
- **Chapter 6: Parallel Processors** — extensions could include pipelining  

### Learning Benefits
- Reinforces the connection between high-level programming constructs and their low-level implementations.  
- Provides insight into how CPUs execute instructions step-by-step.  
- Encourages systematic thinking about instruction execution, memory access, and control flow.  
- By writing the simulator, students "play computer," which solidifies ISA fundamentals.

## 2. Cache Simulator

### Description
Students create a program that simulates CPU caches under different configurations. Input is a trace of memory accesses (provided by instructor or generated by a test program). Students must implement direct-mapped, set-associative, and fully associative caches, then compare hit/miss rates.

### Textbook Connection
- **Chapter 5: The Memory Hierarchy** — caching principles, spatial/temporal locality, replacement policies  
- **Chapter 1: Introduction** — performance metrics (CPI, AMAT)  

### Learning Benefits
- Makes abstract cache design concrete by requiring students to model it computationally.  
- Highlights the performance impact of memory hierarchy on programs.  
- Shows how algorithm choice (e.g., array vs linked list) interacts with hardware performance.  
- Provides a bridge to real-world system design trade-offs in computer architecture.

## 3. Virtual Memory Visualizer

### Description
A Python program that simulates virtual-to-physical address translation. Students implement a simple page table and a translation lookaside buffer (TLB). Given memory accesses, the program shows address breakdown (page number + offset), whether a page fault occurs, and the final physical address.

### Textbook Connection
- **Chapter 5: The Memory Hierarchy** — paging, virtual memory, TLBs, page faults  
- **Chapter 7: Storage and I/O** — connection between memory and storage for page swapping  

### Learning Benefits
- Reinforces the concept of abstraction in memory systems.  
- Helps students understand how virtual memory protects and shares resources.  
- Develops appreciation for the complexity of address translation and performance costs of page faults.  
- Provides a visual, step-by-step model of a key real-world system.

## 4. Pipeline Simulator

### Description
Students model a 5-stage instruction pipeline (Fetch, Decode, Execute, Memory, Writeback). Given a short program, the simulator should display instructions in each stage per cycle, and handle hazards by stalling or forwarding.

### Textbook Connection
- **Chapter 4: The Processor** — single-cycle datapath and pipelining concepts  
- **Chapter 6: Parallel Processors** — pipeline hazards, instruction-level parallelism  

### Learning Benefits
- Makes visible the benefits and challenges of pipelining.  
- Demonstrates hazards and why they reduce performance.  
- Provides hands-on experience with design trade-offs (stalling vs forwarding).  
- Reinforces how modern CPUs improve throughput without changing clock speed.

## 5. ARM-to-Python Translator

### Description
A tool that parses a small subset of ARM assembly instructions and outputs equivalent Python code. For example, `ADD r0, r1, r2` might be converted into `r0 = r1 + r2`.

### Textbook Connection
- **Chapter 2: Instructions** — ARM ISA basics  
- **Chapter 3: Arithmetic for Computers** — integer/floating-point operations  
- **Chapter 4: The Processor** — control flow and branches  

### Learning Benefits
- Strengthens the student’s ability to move between low-level assembly and high-level constructs.  
- Develops parsing and translation skills, useful in compilers and interpreters.  
- Shows concretely how compilers "map" high-level code to low-level instructions.

## 6. Disassembly Explorer

### Description
Students write small C programs (loops, conditionals, functions), compile them for ARM using a provided toolchain, and then analyze the disassembly. They must explain how constructs like loops, if-statements, and function calls appear at the assembly level.

### Textbook Connection
- **Chapter 2: Instructions** — instruction formats and branching  
- **Chapter 3: Arithmetic** — arithmetic instructions and operations  
- **Chapter 4: The Processor** — execution of control flow  

### Learning Benefits
- Builds confidence reading and reasoning about real assembly code.  
- Connects high-level programming experience to machine-level representation.  
- Reinforces compiler role in bridging high-level abstractions with hardware execution.

## 7. Multithreaded Matrix Multiply

### Description
Implement matrix multiplication sequentially, then with Python’s `threading` or `multiprocessing`. Measure runtime for increasing matrix sizes and thread counts, and compare results.

### Textbook Connection
- **Chapter 1: Introduction** — performance and parallelism  
- **Chapter 6: Parallel Processors** — multicore execution, Amdahl’s Law  

### Learning Benefits
- Demonstrates benefits and limitations of parallel execution.  
- Reinforces key performance principles like scalability and bottlenecks.  
- Provides hands-on context for multicore processor discussions.  
- Shows why parallelism is not “free” and introduces real-world considerations (synchronization, overhead).

## 8. Encryption Engine

### Description
Students implement classical ciphers (Caesar, Vigenère, simple RSA). For each, they analyze performance in terms of number of operations and relate to hardware instruction efficiency. Bitwise operations should be emphasized.

### Textbook Connection
- **Chapter 3: Arithmetic for Computers** — binary, modular arithmetic, bitwise ops  
- **Chapter 5: The Memory Hierarchy** — performance of repeated operations  

### Learning Benefits
- Provides a fun, applied domain (security/cryptography) while reinforcing low-level arithmetic.  
- Encourages students to think about efficiency of algorithms at the hardware level.  
- Connects abstract arithmetic to a concrete application area.

## 9. CPU Scheduling Simulator

### Textbook Connection
- **Chapter 7: Storage and I/O** — I/O scheduling, performance metrics  
- Reinforces general **performance measurement** principles introduced in **Chapter 1**  

### Learning Benefits
- Provides a bridge between hardware organization and operating systems.  
- Demonstrates how scheduling affects perceived performance.  
- Encourages visualization of processes over time, reinforcing parallelism concepts.

## 10. Group Challenge: Toy Computer System

### Description
Class divides into small teams. Each team contributes one part of a toy computer:  
- Group A: Define an instruction set.  
- Group B: Write an assembler.

- Gives students a holistic view of how different parts of a system fit together.  
- Provides flexibility for both creative design and rigorous implementation.  
- Encourages teamwork, integration, and testing skills.
